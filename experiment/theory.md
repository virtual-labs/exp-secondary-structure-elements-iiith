**Deconvolution**

Let us now consider the CD spectrum as a mathematical functional or signal. We will first see what is called convolution of such signals.

Convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions, producing a third function that is typically viewed as a modified version of one of the original functions. In this context these initial functions are CD spectra of known pure secondary structures which convolute to give rise to a complex spectrum of a real protein.

Deconvolution is an algorithm-based process used to reverse the effects of convolution on recorded data. Now to deconvolute a CD spectrum of a protein sample we have to:

 1. Obtain a proper set of basis.
 2. Perform the data fitting procedure.
