 Purpose of this lab is to give students an idea of how CD spectrum of a protein sample is deconvoluted and how information about secondary structure of the protein sample can be obtained from it. By doing this lab an user will be able to understand,

    1. Different techniques of deconvolution of CD spectrum of a protein sample.

    2. How to get information about secondary structures of a protein from its CD spectra.
    
    3. How to classify a protein sample in terms of its secondary structure elements.
