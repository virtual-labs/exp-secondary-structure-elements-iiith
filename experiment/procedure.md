Step1 : Select any one sample from the list of four samples and click "continue".  
Step2 : The next step shows variation of ellipticity (in milli-degrees) with wavelength (in nm) of both the sample spectrum and base line. It also shows the sample and experimental environment details. Click "Substract Baseline From Sample" to go to the next step.  
Step3 : In this step a graph is shown where baseline is substracted from the sample spectrum. You can go "back" to review the previous step or "continue" to the next step.  
Step4 : In this step you are given 3 options. Among them you have to select one method of Deconvolution and "Run" the experiment.  
Step5 : This step shows the result of deconvolution. From the information given in the result window you have to decide in which class does the protein sample belong. If you are not sure you can "Repeat Deconvolution" with other methods. And then submit your "answer".    
Step6 : This step will show whether your result is right or wrong.
